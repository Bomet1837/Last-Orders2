  "carmen_firstMeet_closed_0": "They have all that money and yet choose to do nothing with it, what's even the point?",
  "carmen_firstMeet_closed_1": "Oh, your poor reputation!",
  "carmen_firstMeet_closed_2": "What do you think's gonna happen when your family grows a pair of eyes and realizes that you're dating one of those layabouts?",
  "carmen_rebuttal_closed_0": "But there has to be a better way!",
  "carmen_rebuttal_closed_1": "What if it had taken us a few more years to meet each other?",
  "carmen_rebuttal_closed_2": "And in that time, I ended up running out of money and never got to meet you?",
  "carmen_rebuttal_closed_3": "It's a hypothetical in this case, but god knows how many wonderful lives have been ruined because of these wealthy old farts' inability to act.",
  "carmen_rebuttal_closed_4": "...Sorry, I'm just stressed with everything at the moment",
  "sapphire_firstMeetCrashout_closed_0": "I'll have my usual.",

  "carmen_conspiracy_closed_1": "I heard the old geezer fired the new bartender again…",
  "sapphire_conspiracy_closed_2": "Really? Did he do something?",
  "carmen_conspiracy_closed_3": "I don’t know… My old friends in the force say he reported them for something and now they have to investigate them.",
  "sapphire_conspiracy_closed_4": "Sounds serious... Could it have something to do with the Rebels?",
  "carmen_conspiracy_closed_5": "Maybe.",
  "sapphire_conspiracy_closed_6": "I don’t get the Rebels’ practices at all, darling. Though I like what they preach.",
  "carmen_conspiracy_closed_7": "Shh, honey. Don’t want anyone to overhear you and for it to get back to your parents.",
  "sapphire_conspiracy_closed_8": "I suppose you’re right… *she chuckles* I don’t want them to slap my wrist.",
  "sapphire_conspiracy_closed_9": "Do you think we should order drinks now?",
  "carmen_conspiracy_closed_10": "Yes, I’ll go order them now- *Carmen notices the player standing by the booth* Oh, I was about to go over and order.",
  "carmen_conspiracy_closed_11": "Nice to meet you, you must be the new guy. Since you’ll see us a lot, I’ll introduce ourselves. I’m Carmen and this sparkling gem you see next to me is my wonderful wife Sapphire.",
  "sapphire_conspiracy_closed_12": "Charmed.",
  "sapphire_conspiracy_choice_13": "Can I take your order?|Nice to meet you. May I take your orders then?|What were you talking about?|…",

  "axel_aboutMutants_closed_0": "Hey. Has your boss said anything about mutants?",
  "axel_aboutMutants_choice_1": "What's a mutant?|Um, no...?",
  "axel_recruitInto_closed_0": "Well, most mutants round here are supposed to be reported to the authorities, right?",
  "axel_recruitInto_closed_1": "I have a different solution to this \"problem\" if you catch my drift.",
  "axel_recruitInto_closed_2": "What I'm asking you is, if you happen to see any mutants come in here, do me a favour and just let me know, ok?",
  "axel_recruitInto_closed_3": "Now that that's sorted, please could I have a [DRINK PLACE HOLDER]?",
  "axel_whatIsMutant_closed_0": "What- you seriously don't know?",
  "axel_whatIsMutant_closed_1": "The people affected by the radiation that's seeped in from the surface.",
  "axel_whatIsMutant_closed_2": "It gives some people strange abilities, like stronger muscles, faster thinking, y'know, that sorta thing.",
  "axel_whatIsMutant_closed_3": "Anyway, if you happen to spot some just do me a solid and let *me* know, rather than any authorities.",
  "axel_whatIsMutant_closed_4": "Last thing- you do [DRINK PLACE HOLDER], right? Could I have a pint of that, please?"
